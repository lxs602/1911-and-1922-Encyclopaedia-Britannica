# 1911-and-1922-Encyclopaedia-Britannica

<b><i>"[An] amazing compendium of scholarship and fact..."</i></b>
-- Charles Elliott, The Literary Review

<b><i>“probably the finest edition of the Britannica ever issued, and it ranks with the Enciclopedia Italiana and the Espasa as one of the three greatest encyclopaedias... positioned in time as a summary of the world’s knowledge just before the outbreak of World War I” </i></b>
-- Collison, Robert. Encyclopedias: Their History Throughout the Ages. New York: Hafner, 1964. Print.
