<h3>1911 Encyclopædia Britannica - Wikisource's Project Disclaimer</h3>

<h4>Use of Title</h4>

Use of the title Encyclopædia Britannica is strictly to acknowledge the original title of this material, which has gone into the public domain due to the expiration of the copyright of this material. Any reference to this material should explicitly note the original date of publication (1911), the edition (11th), or both.

<h4>Inaccuracies</h4>

Articles from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica are based upon the information available to the editors and contributors at the time of their original publication in the early 20th century. Changing circumstances and more recent research may have rendered this information obsolete or revealed it to be inaccurate, especially in the areas of science, law, and ethnography. In addition, lapses from neutrality of the contributors and editors and their political or social attitudes can introduce bias to the articles. Readers should bear this in mind when using the information.

<h4>Errors in Transcription</h4>

These articles are transcribed from the originals by volunteers, sometimes directly and sometimes by correcting a preliminary OCR conversion. We strive for absolute accuracy, but the articles may suffer errors in transcription.

<h3>Wikisource's notes on reading its edition of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica</h3>

Whilst the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica is known as outstanding reference text, it is over one hundred years old, and so the style and presentation are somewhat different from what people expect today. Some notes by Wikipedians are given here to assist the reader in understanding the text.

<h4>POV issues</h4>

The point of view held by the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica is roughly the one of the British and American educated classes at the beginning of the twentieth century. Any topic that would be sensitive to this point-of-view (POV) should be considered potentially biased, and verified with other sources before being copied and pasted into Wikipedia. Examples of biased articles imported in Wikipedia are the ones about French First Empire, the Stockholm Bloodbath, and king Umberto I of Italy. Often, an acceptably non-POV article can be obtained by filtering out or moderating biased or inaccurate statements.

The Wikisource version of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica must never be edited for POV. Its purpose is to record the text exactly as it was written. A copy of the Wikisource text can be made and edited elsewhere in the manner suggested above.

<h4>Units and measurements</h4>

All units and measurements are imperial as the text was written before British metrification.

<h4>Paragraph length</h4>

For reasons of cost and academic writing style, the paragraphs are rather long in length, making reading somewhat tiresome on the eyes.

<h4>Authorities</h4>

At the end of some articles is a section called "Authorities." This is a record of all the sources used when writing the article. The reader may consider this the combination of today's Citations, References and Bibliography sections in modern reference texts.

<h4>Contributors</h4>

Contributors to articles are sometimes identified by their initials in parentheses at the end of the article. The initials may be linked to the "Author" page in Wikisource. A cross-reference of initials to author name is located at the beginning of each volume (e.g. Vol 1 Table of contributors). The alphabetical list of contributors is found at the end of Volume 29.

<h4>Work in progress</h4>

Some articles, although present, may be in a very unfinished state: images and diagrams may need to be included; tables may need to be formatted; the text may need formatting and proofreading, and may be incomplete.
